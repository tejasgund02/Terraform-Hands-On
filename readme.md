# Terraform Installation Guide

## Introduction
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install Terraform on a Debian-based system.

## Prerequisites
Ensure your system has the following installed:
- Ubuntu/Debian-based Linux distribution
- `curl` and `wget`
- `sudo` privileges

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Update the System
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common
```

### Step 2: Add the HashiCorp GPG Key
```bash
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \
gpg --dearmor | \
sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
```

### Step 3: Verify the Key Fingerprint
```bash
gpg --no-default-keyring \
--keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg \
--fingerprint
```

### Step 4: Add the HashiCorp Repository
```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] \
https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
```

### Step 5: Update the Package List
```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Step 6: Install Terraform
```bash
sudo apt-get install terraform
```

## Verify Installation
To confirm Terraform is installed, run:
```bash
terraform -version
```
You should see an output similar to:
```
Terraform v1.x.x
```

## Conclusion
Terraform is now installed and ready for use. You can start writing Terraform configurations to manage infrastructure efficiently.
